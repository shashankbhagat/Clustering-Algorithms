# Clustering-Algorithms

The project includes implementation of k-means clustering.
The first approach is done by the following steps:
1. Intialisation - randomly assigning k centroids
2. Assignment - assigning the near data points by calculating the Euclidean distance
3. Update - updating the centroid by the mean of the data points in each cluster.
Iterating steps 2 and 3 until convergence is met.

Second approach is done by using scikit-learn package for KMean.
